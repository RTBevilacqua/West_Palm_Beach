West Palm Beach is a web page that I designed using mobile first. 

The idea behind the creation of this page was to make a site that was cleaner and more visual pleasing than typical sites for cities to attract visitors.

My thoughts behind the simplicity were to leave out information and if someone sees something they like they can do a search. Ex "West Palm Beach bars" this way the user can search for bars that he/she likes and not see ones that are bias from the designer.

Think of more info, edit this later.
